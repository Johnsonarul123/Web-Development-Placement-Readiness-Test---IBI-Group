The code will output the following to the console:
array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s

Explaination:
The code creates two arrays arr1 and arr2, 
both containing the characters of the string "john" in reversed order. 
Then, it creates another array arr3 with the characters of the string "jones". 
Next, it adds arr3 as a subarray to the end of arr2. 
Finally, the code logs the length and the last element of arr1 and arr2 to the console. 
As a result, both arr1 and arr2 end up having the same content, 
and they include the subarray ["j", "o", "n", "e", "s"] as their last element.
