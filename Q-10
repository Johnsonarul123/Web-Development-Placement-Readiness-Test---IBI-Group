The output of the code will be:

1
4
2
3

Explaination:
 the code logs the numbers 1 and 4 to the console immediately. 
 Then, it schedules the execution of two functions, printNumber(2) and printNumber(3), using setTimeout.
 Despite the setTimeout delay being 0 milliseconds for printNumber(2), 
 it will still be executed after printNumber(3) because of the JavaScript event loop.
So, the final output sequence is 1, 4, 2, and 3.
